```

## 1. Confidence Intervals

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38,41,50,27,32,41,48,60,43)

t.test(otter_length)
```
##T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim that mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test #since stored in environment, call to see output
```
## Two-sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
